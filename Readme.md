Smart contract tests:
![My Image](testcases_pic.png)

Instructions
-Git clone ........

Set up backend
-cd back-qdvote
-yarn
-Crate your .env file [for future sake of testnet + auto link backend abi/contract address to frontend]
.env example
MATIC_RPC_URL = https://rpc-mumbai.maticvigil.com/v1/..........
PRIVATE_KEY = 8.......e [done use real one lol]
UPDATE_FRONT_END=true

Test backend
-yarn hardhat test 

Deploy backend to localhost
-yarn hardhat node [take note of private keys of generated accounts]
-yarn hardhat deploy â€”-network localhost (make sure to use two dashes)


Set up frontend
-cd front-qdvote
-yarn
-yarn dev 

btw this error below sometimes come up, but it seems not breaking anything
Ignore Unhandled Runtime Error
TypeError: Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'itemCount')


Test App
-Import your localhost private key in Metamask, add localhost network and play around
-Local host may get confused sometimes, so use setting--> advanced--> reset account for 
your auto-generated address in metamask. [dont mess up your real account.]
